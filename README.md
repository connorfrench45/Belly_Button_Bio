The page also has a contextulization paragraph and header and little descriptions of each visualization.
## Future Updates
There's always more ways to prettify a webpage, and this one is no exception. For instance, this page could potentially be updated with information and styling from Improbable Beef's website.
Another future improvement could be within the data analyzing itself. As is, this is only a visualization. Dynamic tables, ability to compare test subjects could be among future improvements that could help future analysis.
